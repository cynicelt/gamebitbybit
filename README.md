Iterative Game Dev in the Godot Engine - 2D Platform

## An idea to help me build out a Godot 2D Platform Game
Basically for the past 4 months I've had a non-working day every second week to take time off, but also to pick up a new hobby of Game Dev. I've picked Godot for a number of reasons, but primarily because it's free, it supports both 2D and 3D, and it seems to lend itself really well to 2D Platforms which occupy a soft spot in my heart.

However, I kept borking up progress, because:
- I wouldn't keep the efforts up
- I got distracted playing games that were already published (aka God of War)
- The weather got better and I kept going to the range.

I have a new plan I want to put in place.

## The new plan

1. Create a simple platform with a simple character, basic animations and background
2. Add collectible coins, add the result of the coin to an overall coin counter, play a sound when the coin is collected
3. Add Nasties in. If the player touches the nasty (no matter where from), play a deed animation
4. I called this the "Gainz" step while I was scribbling the notes for this approach on the train this morning - I have zero recollection of it except for a pencil-drawing saying "Blue Power". So I don't think I'm trying to establish some superior smurf-race, I think what I mean by this isss......ADD MORE COLLECTIBLES, MAKE THEM BLUE BOTTLES, BLUE BOTTLES GIVE THE PLAYER INFALLIBILITY FOR 30 SECONDS OR SUMMAT
5. Theme Change. There are multiple colour schemes available in the free tileset I've downloaded, I'm going to change the background music when the player walks into each new colour scheme. I'm going to limit the changes to 2 for this game.
6. SWORDS. ADD SWORDS. Collect the Sword, which then attaches itself to your character, add a sword animation and key binding, and use it to deed nasties. This is a ridiculously large step in comparison to the others so I may end up breaking this one down.
7. Now in the same pencil scribbling I've also added "Super Power" and as I was typing out some self-directed vitriol I remembered what I wanted to do. This is to trigger a screen-wide animation upon said collection of BLUE BOTTLES - i.e. anime-style, darken the screen and have a white ball of focus on the player for a minute, maybe play some funky sound effect. Again this sounds fairly large so I'll also break this down in due course.
8. ADD A SHOP. This is a stupidly large step so I may break this down again. I'll need to figure out ANOTHER key binding.

Number of key bindings:
- Up, Left, Right > OBVIOUSLY
- 'Interact' > open door
- 'Swing sword' > erm, well...swing de sword
- 'Drink the BLUE BOTTLE' > I don't know why I've now permanently capitalised the powerup but here we are, enjoy the ride.
